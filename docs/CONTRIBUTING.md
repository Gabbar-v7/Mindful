# 🙏 **Acknowledgements & Disclaimer**  

First off, thank you for even considering contributing to **Mindful**. This project exists because of passionate people like you who believe in something bigger than themselves.  

### **Before you contribute**  
I just want to be upfront about a few things:  
- Any contributions you make - whether it’s code, ideas, or assets `become part of Mindful`. You won’t own the rights to them, but your impact will live on in every user who benefits from your work.  
- `Mindful will always be free and open-source.` No hidden paywalls, no selling out. Just a tool to help people take control of their screen time.  
- I don’t make much from this project, and as much as I’d love to share donations, they just don’t exist in any meaningful way. What I `can` do is give `credit` where it’s due. If there’s a way to acknowledge your work, I’ll make sure it happens.  
- I might update these terms down the road, not to take anything away from you, but to protect the project and keep it `truly open and free`  

### **If this doesn’t sit right with You**  
I get it. If you’re not comfortable with these terms, _**please don’t feel discouraged**_. You can still open an issue or request a feature, and I’ll do my best to bring your idea to life. Your voice still matters.  

And just so you know `Mindful will never be abandoned.` As long as I’m around, I’ll keep improving it. That’s my promise.  

Thank you for being here. <br> You matter more than you know 💙
